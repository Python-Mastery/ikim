# Ikim
A modern reusable blog extension for the Flask micro framework.

## use cases
1. Easily add a blog to a flask app. Most web applications require a blog section. This will provide a modern and complete solution.

2. Deploy as a standalone blog. You can add the app to a skeletal flask app and deploy as a complete solution. If you need extra features (i.e extra pages, payment system etc)
that are not blog features, you should add those yourself.
